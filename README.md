The 42 All star group was created to discover a business project,
and explore technologies not necessarily used in our school (api request, simulation, etc.).
this project challenged us on our knowledge and ability to discover a different environment,
but also on our ability to make a project report readable for others.

to run our code:

follow the vrx/aquabot project installation requirement:

https://github.com/sirehna/Aquabot#installation

https://github.com/sirehna/Aquabot-Competitor#installation

→    “sudo apt-get update”
→    “sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev”

to run our code, don’t forget to source your installation “.bash/.zsh/...” and launch your sim world with “ros2 launch ...”.

→    “ros2 run all_star BabySharky”

warning: our code needs to be re-launched whenever a windTurbin has been scanned, or it won’t find them on the next simulation run !
